    developer. This past semester, I did a co-op at Bain & Company where I was involved in the product management department. Although 
    I didn’t directly do any coding, I was given the responsibility of managing their knowledge base articles revolving around 
    Microsoft Teams software where I had to edit the designs of the web pages. Here, I learned a good amount of the actual user 
    interface of a web page, but not much about the coding elements behind the scenes. Reading the websites assigned was very 
    interesting to me since that is a hole in my current knowledge about front-end development.
	
    
        While I knew that there were a lot of aspects to front-end development, I didn’t realize there were so many elements that 
    are widely different. There are both highly technical aspects to learn, such as writing HTML and Javascript, while there are 
    creative elements, like designing user interfaces and writing CSS. Overall, it is a blend of computer science and design. The 
    roadmap also solidified my knowledge in what full stack development is. Previously, I knew it involved front-end development and 
    more technical aspects, but now I realize how much weight of front-end development there is in the position.
