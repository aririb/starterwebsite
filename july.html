      Summary of the month in a paragraph below images
    -->
    <p>
        I spent July as a time to relax since it was my first time not working a 9-5 in six months.
        I enjoyed most of this time by hanging out with friends and visiting family. My family even
        went on a day-long trip to Maine in an area that my grandfather grew up in.

        I also started working part-time as a peer leader for the summer program SoarCS, which is 
        designed to help incoming computer science freshmen adapt to the college life. I taught some 
        simple computer science lessons as well as moderated the Discord server for the program. I
        had a lot of fun doing this and hope to participate next summer!
