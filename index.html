      <p>This summer was a mix of professional development and unforgettable experiences, and I think it was my
        best summer yet. First, I finished the last two months of my first six-month co-op, which allowed me to apply the computer
        science knowledge I've gained in college to real-world projects. My role was in product management which I really grew to
        enjoy.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my work, I made the most of my free time by exploring visiting New York City and Chicago. 
        Attending two music festivals was  definitely a highlight since I've never attended one before. "Head in the Clouds" was
        my favorite since it featured some of my favorite artists as well as highlighed Asian musicians. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After the end of my co-op, I served as a peer leader for SoarCS. It was very rewarding to mentor fellow computer science majors, particularly freshmen. 
        Throughout all of this, I spent time exploring Boston and spending quality time with friends, making this summer an 
        unforgettable chapter of my college journey.
