      Summary of the month in a paragraph below images
    -->
    <p>
        In June, I committed a lot of time to my co-op. I networked with employees from other teams that were involved
        with UX Design because I have an interest in it. Through this, I had the opportunity to shadow the head of UX Design at Bain
        in meetings and brainstorm sessions. I even learned how to use Figma software and some design principles, despite my position
        as an intern in product management.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also spent more time in Boston this month with my school friends who started their internships at companies near me.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm glad I started reaching out to more people in May since it gave me a lot to do during this month, both work-related and personal.
        These two months also set me up for success for the rest of the summer.
    </p>
