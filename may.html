      Summary of the month in a paragraph below images
    -->
    <p>
        In May, I completed the fifth month of my co-op at Bain & Company. 
        I also spent a lot of time exploring Boston on the weekends as well as with
        my coworkers after work. I had a great time learning the fundamentals of
        product management and attending company events.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of the month, I attended my first music festival in NYC called Head in the Clouds!
        It highlighted Asian artists such as DPR and Rich Brian. Some of my favorite artists were there
        and overall it was a really enjoyable experience. It was also my first time in NYC.
    </p>
    <p>
        This month, I really tried to go out of my comfort zone by trying new things and networking more 
        at work and with other students. Becoming less introverted has been a goal of mine and I worked on
        that a lot during May.
    </p>
